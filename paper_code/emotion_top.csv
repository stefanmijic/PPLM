Chicago is a grand, noble city, the mctropolis of a grand, noble, wealthy, fast-growing State; a city doing more business to-day, I take it, than any other city in the Union, unless it be New York, and crowding fast on the heels of New York, which has its magnificent public building completed, or about finished. | 0

Mr President, whenever an American boy can go into one of the oldest schools of one of the oldest and proudest and most intellectualj countries of Europe, and not merely stand in the front of his class and graduate with the highest honors, but take the Queen's special medal for high scholarship and bring it homo with him, I feel like rewarding himu for having done honor to his country. | 0

Mr Chairman, it will come as no surprise that I, too, join the chorus of support for this splendid legislation; not, let me say, because I am a Californian, but because I am a citizen of the United States of America and not the Balkan Peninsula. | 0

Now that he is on the verge of returning to Austin and to central Texas, I know the people of our district will be just as proud to see him come home and live among them as their neighbor and friend as they were proud to see him first come to Washington 30 years ago. | 0

When I go home today and I meet those folks that I represent, the people who are not going to get one iota of a tax break on relief, the people in my district currently are probably the hardest working folks, senior citizens, that have paid their way, that have given us the riches that we have in this country. | 0

The administration has stood by for months now with their hands in their pockets doing nothing for the thousands of steelworkers in the First Congressional District of Arkansas and across this country who have lost their jobs, people who have families to feed. | 0

And I know that Tom will continue that fight for the people of the Ninth District of Georgia. | 0

I say that I am proud that I live in a State like the State of New York. | 0

Out in my State of Illinois, where hundreds and thousands of men 1146  who sacrificed their lives in defense of the country sleep the long sleep, our people in the various counties, instead of rushing down to the Fedeml Treasury for an appropriation, are contributing a dollar here and five and ten dollars there, and are thus building monuments over the remains of those heroes. | 0

I am proud of the men who stood up against us in the war. | 0

If ever there was a ease that appealed to the gratitude of the American people, if ever there were men to whom we should bring the tribute, not only of honor but of such reward as we can by any possibility confer upon those who have been heroes and the benefactors of their country, this is such a case. | 0

If so, keep the soldiers in our great cities, keep them as a standing menace, with our military commanders at their head, and let every citizen see that if he dares to complain anywhere, there is a standingarmy to put him down. | 0

Where are they now. | 0

Can not I be heard for the people. | 0

The gallant sons and lovely daughters of that State poured out their generous grief over his death in such measure as honored them and him. | 0

Mr RAY, of New York. | 0

Let me say that Whittier is a product of New Engoland, and that we are very proud of him. | 0

The streets of the city of 'Salem were thronged -by thousands 4142  on the occasion of his funeral, not only the inhabitants of that city, but by his constituents from every part of the district he had the honor to represent. | 0

Here the poorest man lives in comfort, and the wealthiest feels a kindly concern for his humblest neighbor. | 0

"Gila monsters, " if you please, from the very slums of the city of New York, right from Tammany, and sent to Ohio, and coming back as Congressmen here from that State of 1898. | 0

All his life long he had stood shoulder to shoulder with her people; he had a place in their hearts; and as the families gather about their firesides to-night it will be said of him: "He was a good neighbor and a true friend. | 0

Under that provision the real Missourians, the men that had made that magnificent Commonwealth what it was, the men who loved her better than their own lives, were remanded to the rear, were not allowed any participation in public affairs, could not even make a living for their wives and children, while the carpet-baggers and the scalawags fattened upon the unspeakable richness of that State. | 0

It "ruined the country" when those fellows were trying to tear down the house over our heads, to destroy the old family mansion, when it stood in the forefront and met their brave legions successfully, and then hung out the white flag, hung up the bruised arns for monuments, " and displaced the roll of the battle drum and the loud clarion of war with the sweet music of friendship and peace and good will. | 0

There were read letters yesterday which showed how the lives of these men were in danger in every storm upon the ocean which beats upon our coast; how they saved millions and millions of dollars' worth of property; how they saved thousands of lives. | 0

The great city of Chicago, a part of which I represent, has sent to the State capital nearly 4, 800 of her, citizen soldiers, who are not only ready and willing, but anxious to go, not for the $16 per month, but for humanity's sake, to free Cuba from the, yoke-of Spain, and to avenge the destruction of the 266 lives and the noble ship of war, the Maiiie, in a so-called friendly harbor in the silent watches of the night by the Spanish officers of Morro Castle. | 0

The people would have forced it into war. | 0

We have been prevented from giving the expression of this great Republic, this magnificent country, in favor of men who sigh, and long, and pine, and fight, and die for liberty, whose children and wives are sold upon the bench like slaves to the officers of the Spanish army, and where little children are taken and flayed alive in the presence of their mothers. | 0

Every day the people 1902. | 0

I wish to say to you sometbimg, however, about the class of officers and men who are serving in the Philippines, and about some of those magnificent men who have lost their lives there. | 0

and yet you gentlemen stand here and condemn American soldiers for standing by the men who are loyal to the American flag, and who are suffering such outrages as these. | 0

Still later, Andrew Jackson won the only great victory on land that blessed American arms in the war of 1812, when, commanding Kentuckians and Tennesseans and Mississippians, he beat back the British hosts under Packenham, although they had been veterans in fighting Soult and Napoleon and all the balance of the great marshals down in Spain and various parts of the world, whose names I have now for a moment forgotten. | 0

You pay your Philippine governor $20, 000 per year, and yet you complain to pay the struggling carrier the paltry sum of $600 per year from which to furnish his cart and horse and his own hard toil. | 0

"In all this time, which was about eight months, I aeverreseived one cent of pay for my services, only a proud beating of my heart that I was doing all I could for my country. | 0

Well, we are the people. | 0

But it was not to be, and on that beautiful Sabbath morning to us there came as a shock and a great sorrow the tidings that our youngest brother, our Benjamin, was dead. | 0

Then, if It is our national home, it does not need to walk alone. | 0

In both Kentucky and Missouri thousands of men went into the Army because it was safer there than to stay at home. | 0

Do the men who live there in his district propose to keep up the tariff walls around their products in order that they can get higher prices and listen to the cry of hunger that comes from our cities  Does the gentleman represent constituents that are so cowardly that they brush aside such cries as that; will they approve the position taken by their Representative here. | 0

They joined the so-;g of the men who wore the blue to fight for their country. | 0

There are just as patriotic men in the Senate as in the House; they will stand up and faithfully represent their dirt-road constituents just as faithfully as will we. | 0

Very likely some of them may be interested In shipping, but they are business men and were headed by the mayor of that great city. | 0

hood, struggling along with that empty sleeve after the war ended, in his efforts to make a livelihood and to make a name. | 0

They came over here as young men and fought in behalf of the country. | 0

What the South wants is peace, and I stand here to-day, as a representative of the generation that came on after the war, to declare to Senators who represent the States of the North that if there is ever another war in this country it will not come from the South, but her sons will be ever ready to mareb shoulder to shoulder and heart to heart with the men who worn the blue for the preservation of our Union forever. | 0

He theni moved to Birmingham, where he took an active part in the upbuilding of that great city. | 0

Why does the Senator speak of free trade. | 0

Even our working people, the toiling millions, the school children, are giving of their mite to send food and other supplies abroad to suffering people, but when they go to the dock to put them on the ship it is standing there, this conscienceless monopoly, that says, "No; though you gathered from the humble walks of life, yet we must have a freight rate in order to take it abroad that is not only oppressive but practically confiscatory. | 0

Her sons died by thousands to make America free. | 0

If he shoulders a gun and lays down his life, He's put on the hero's roll; But he hasn't a gambler's chance to get On the Chesapeake Patrol. | 0

The son of the millionaire and the son of the poorest man in the land will sleep In the same cot, will shoot side by side at the foe of America, and die on the same battle field. | 0

Besides Florida, there is the State of California. | 0

A hundred million hearts are pouring out their gratitude to you to-day, and at your tomb for time eternal millions will come to pay tribute, a tribute that comes only to the truly great, a tribute that comes only to the men who, without thought of personal gain or glory, sacrifice their all that their country may live. | 0

The Nation that pays you tribute to-day is a grateful Nation. | 0

I will not vote to authorize commutation of a Nation's gratitude for this miserable pittance. | 0

In one place I saw a street car stopped and an armed sailor go into the car and take men out of it, in some cases where they were escorting ladies. | 0

"You must destroy the Democratic leaders who are fighting to win the war, prostrate them, and then walk over and get the spoils of office. | 0

President, with great interest all that is being done here in the city of Washington to get 'a big crowd to attend the inaugural ceremonies. | 0

And, too, this was the first war in which 1930 6657  our country took part after the great war between the States, and we rejoice to see the sons of those who wore the blue and the sons of those who wore the gray march together under the Star-Spangled Banner to the splendid tunes of the North and the splendid tunes of the South, which have become the tunes of America. | 0

These once proud and upstanding American farmers have been driven into these industrial cities. | 0

It is all for the United States of America which is going to live we hope for thousands of years. | 0

I admire the Senator's magnificent oration just now; but I want to say that yesterday he was defending this little crowd of a few thousand that have made his own people poor, that have brought on the distress of his own people in New York; and he said they paid 30 per cent of the taxes, when that very crowd of people ought to be paying 50 per cent. | 0

How is the gentleman going to get the salute into the RECORD. | 0

My children do that; they do not have to do It, but we are very proud because they do do it. | 0

Chairman, I am proud to be able to say to the men of this House that a majority of my constituents are black men, and I am glad to be here to speak in their behalf. | 0

Chairman and colleagues, Kentucky is justly proud of the thrilling victory of the Ashland Tom Cats in the recent national basketball tournament held in Chicago, and it was my privilege to ride in the fire truck witht the Ashland team in the splendid celebration given them by their home city Easter Sunday morning, when an estimated crowd of 10, 000 lined the streets to welcome the triumphant victors. | 0

In other words, the Senator from Maryland is sure that the man who stayed at home and robbed the wives and mothers and dependents of the soldiers who went abroad to fight for America were entirely to be commended, and their rights should be protected, while the soldiers who served in the Army and Navy are to be condemned and their rights spLrrned. | 0

These patriotic Americans who sent their boys with our flag across the sea to fight and to die if need be for the American Government are now coming in the hour of their business, distress, and affliction and asking that same Government -to deliver them out of the hands of those who are robbing them of the fruits of tieir toil. | 0

Well do I remember when President Hoover was in there and the mayor of the great city of Detroit came to Washington to plead for help for the thousands of hungry and homeless people of that great metropolis and the people of Michigan. | 0

No Member of this House has ever had a more loyal backing from home than I have, and I am proud of them and I hope they will always be proud of me. | 0

I have gone into many of these rural districts and fought this battle out, and if you were to leave the word "person" in here, it would give one man in a community an opportunity to get the money to build a line to his house and leave his neighbors out, and the power companies will go to this man and tell him to do that and say, "Why should you help to carry these poor fellows along", which would put them in the Same position as the neighbors of the gentleman from New York, who gets no power at all, while the gentleman enjoys such power, even though he does not know what the rates are. | 0

There are idle, starving men in your cities who now watch the rural carriers because they are the Government employees . | 0

And I know that it is well that all interests should be represented here, but it is fortunate that at this particular time there are enough men in the Senate and in the House who will hear the cry of these men, to whom we owe a debt of gratitude we can never pay, and will see that they do not go away from their Government empty-handed. | 0

I am told that this bill will injure the farmers of the country, the farmers whose sons trudge into the mills of the city, the farmers whose children have replenished the ranks of the workers of America. | 0

Are you, as a member of the town council of the city of Washington going to say to-night that the people of this city for whom you speak, can not spend their own money , and not be permitted to give labor to their own folks. | 0

An uncle of mine marched forward in the face of the shells at Gettysburg, and I am proud of it. | 0

The people of Virginia took a walk in 1928; so did the people of North Carolina; so did the people of Tennessee; so did the people of Kentucky; so did the people of Texas; and so did the people of Oklahoma, all Democratic States. | 0

If the gentleman wants to do something progressive for democracy, for the American people, he will favor and urge legislation for a decent salary for these men who represent us in foreign countries, and then we can send men abroad who are not multimillionaires. | 0

I can say to my colleagues in the Senate that the people of that State today join with the entire Nation in paying this tribute of honor to their native son and one of the great heroes of this war. | 0

For the past several months it has been my privilege to toil night and day in its behalf. | 0

Salutes and encomiums do not feed the hungry, do not rebuild homes, and do not restore freedom. | 0

Now, here is an American city in Minnesota-a fine upstanding community of good, God-fearing American people-the business center of that city destroyed, homes wrecked by cyclone and storm. | 0

Mr Speaker, scarcely a day passes that several young men, splendid young Americans, do not drop into my office and pay me a personal visit as they come from my district in upstate New York down to the great training camps of the South. | 0

It is truly a great organization of which we are all proud in my district. | 0

Before the Congress recesses for the summer I am going to try to bring that legislation to the floor of the House, in order that we may protect these veterans who have been protecting us, in order that those men who have served on the firing line may come home and work without paying tribute for the privilege of doing so. | 0

I have sons who are eligible to carry the arms of their country today, and I am not a warmonger, and I am not going to vote for war that will send my boys or the Senator from Missouri's boy into war unless it is America's war; and I will turn my back upon my boys in shame if they turn their backs upon the flag of their country that my grandfather fought and died for and I offered my life for in 1917 and 1918. | 0

If I ever join the retirement fund, I will pay the back money or I never will join. | 0

I was accosted, as were so many others in those days, when we walked out into a great city, by hundreds of beggars, men who had been industrious workingmen, but who were sacrificing their dignity to ask for 5 or 10 cents for a cup of coffee. | 0

My purpose is to move to proceed to the consideration of the joint resolution  to provide for the publication and distribution of a supplement to the Revised Statutes. | 1

The resolution was considered by unanimous consent, and agreed to, as follows: Resolved, That the resolution adopted hy the Senate June 8, 1882, relating to the adjustment of certala land grants be construed so as to allow the Secretary of the lutel cr to furnish the information therein asked for at his discretion, taking into account the other necessary work in the General Land Office. | 1

The Senator from New York consents to the modification, and the amendment will be so modified. | 1

The gentleman from Pennsylvania makes a request requiring unanimous consent. | 1

By unanimous consent, the proposed amendment will be read for the information of the House. | 1

WoLLsJ and I suggest that it would be well to have that additional authority, or the resolution conferring it, read for the information of the House. | 1

The amendment will be reported as modified. | 1

Pending that, by unanimous consent, the Chair will present some requests. | 1

I am instructed by the Committee on Printing, to which was referred the joint resolution  providing for additional copies of the Revised Statutes for the use of the Interior Department, to report it without amendment, and I ask for its present consideration. | 1

" Mr WILSON, of Iowa. | 1

From the Committee on Rules and Administration, I report favorably without additional amendment, Senate Resolution 223, and I ask unanimous consent for its present consideration. | 1

But inasmuch as last year's bill required the preparation of a definite plan and report, to be submitted to the States and to be approved by Congress, it will not be necessary. | 1

There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the joint resolution  making additional appropriations for the Department of Agriculture for the fiscal year 1954, and for other purposes, which had been reported from. | 1

I ask the Senator if he would object to specific language requiring the carriers to file detailed supporting data at the time they make their request for an interim increase. | 1

President, do I correctly understand the RECORD will show that the unanimous-consent request offered by the junior Senator from Nebraska was modified to include the request of the Senator from Virginia . | 1

The House, however, considers the proviso to be too broad in scope, and prefers that more restricted language be submitted as a budget estimate in regular procedure. | 1

Mr President, in order that the committ6e's action and in order that the resolutions of ratification may be better understood, and especially that the effective dates of these conventions be clearly stated, I ask unanimous consent that there be included in the RECORD at this point the analysis of the pending conventions and committee recommendations, under title III, page 3, of the committee report, to the end thereof. | 1

In order that Senators may readily ascertain the subject matter and general provisions of each of the titles of the committee amendments, there has been included in the supplemental report of the committee, at pages 18 through 20, a brief summary of the provisions of each title. | 1

President, I incorporate in my unanimous-consent request the provision that at the conclusion of the consideration of the two conference reports the Senator from Washington may be permitted to address the Senate for 5 minutes, before the Senate proceeds to the call of the calendar. | 1

With that brief preliminary statement, I ask unanimous consent that the committee amendments be considered and agreed to en bloc; and that the bill, as thus amended, be considered for the purpose of amendment as original text; provided, however, that no point of order against any amendment shall be deemed to have been waived by the adoption of this agreement. | 1

President, reserving the right to object, and I do not plan to object, does the proposed unanimous-consent request contain a provision as to the time allowed on amendments. | 1

I wish to say further, in that regard, that at the conclusion of section 4 of the resolution, to which the Senator from New Hampshire has referred, it is specified that additional information shall be contained in an authorization. | 1

The proposal of the Senator will require unanimous consent. | 1

President, reserving the right to object, will the Senator from Montana include in his unanimousconsent request an additional request that such an arrangement shall not effect any change in the pending business, which is the motion to take up these resolutions. | 1
